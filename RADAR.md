## Papers

### [Real Time RADAR SLAM](https://www.uni-das.de/images/pdf/veroeffentlichungen/2017/01.pdf) by Markus Schoen, Markus Horn, Markus Hahn, Juergen Dickmann (2017)

A SLAM algorithm using an odometer and radar sensor (x4, in total 360degree coverage) with a particle based localization algorithm combined with 2D occupancy grid mapping.

### Precise Ego-Motion Estimation with Millimeter-Wave Radar under Diverse and Challenging Conditions by Sarah H. Cen and Paul Newman (2018)



### Real-Time Pose Graph SLAM based on RADAR by Martin Holder, Sven Hellwig and Hermann Winner (2019)

SLAM algorithm to construct a map from Radar detections using the ICP method to match consecutive scans obtained from a single, front-facing Radar sensor. An important contribution of this paper is that the radar detections are not immediately matched with ICP but are first merged with consecutive Radar scans based on the odometry pose estimates creating "submaps" of the environment.

### PhaRaO: Direct Radar Odometry using Phase Correlation by Yeong Sang Park, Young-Sik Shin and Ayoung Kim (2020)

Main contribution of this paper is to use a direct method to estimate the odometry based on a Radar Sensor. Instead of using a feature-based method to estimate the odometry from the radar sensor. Specifically, they apply the Fourier Mellin transform (FMT) for Cartesian and log-polar radar images (phase correlation).

### RadarSLAM: Radar based Large-Scale SLAM in All Weathers by Ziyang Hong, Yvan Petillot and Sen Wang (2020)
