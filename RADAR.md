### [Real Time RADAR SLAM](https://www.uni-das.de/images/pdf/veroeffentlichungen/2017/01.pdf) by Markus Schoen, Markus Horn, Markus Hahn, Juergen Dickmann (2017)

A SLAM algorithm using an odometer and radar sensor (x4, in total 360degree coverage) with a particle based localization algorithm combined with 2D occupancy grid mapping.

### Real-Time Pose Graph SLAM based on RADAR by Martin Holder, Sven Hellwig and Hermann Winner

SLAM algorithm to construct a map from Radar detections using the ICP method to match consecutive scans obtained from a single, front-facing Radar sensor. An important contribution of this paper is that the radar detections are not immediately matched with ICP but are first merged with consecutive Radar scans based on the odometry pose estimates creating "submaps" of the environment.
